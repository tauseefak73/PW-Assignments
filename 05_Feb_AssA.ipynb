    "Four Pillars of OOPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation : This is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class. Encapsulation helps to hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world, making it harder for other parts of the program to access or modify them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction : Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal implementation details. It helps to reduce complexity and make the code more modular and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance : Inheritance is the concept of creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class inherits the attributes and methods of the existing class and can also add new attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the concept of having multiple forms or behaviors of an object. This can be achieved through method overriding or method overloading."
